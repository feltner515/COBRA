# Introduction to Contact

Users are expected to have worked through the [Introduction to Tensor Mechanics](tensor_mechanics/tutorials/introduction/index.md) tutorial first.

## [First contact](contact/tutorials/introduction/step01.md)

Continuing from the [final step](tensor_mechanics/tutorials/introduction/step04.md)
in the tensor mechanics tutorial we add a first attempt at mechanical contact.

## [Mortar Contact](contact/tutorials/introduction/step02.md)

We learn how to use the mortar formulation for mechanical contact.
