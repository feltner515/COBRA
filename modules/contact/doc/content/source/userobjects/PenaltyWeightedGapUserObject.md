# PenaltyWeightedGapUserObject

## Description

The `PenaltyWeightedGapUserObject` object computes a normal weighted gap by
looping over mortar segments and penalizes it by a penalty factor to create
a distributed generalized force that can be directly applied as an interface
action on both sides of the contact interface. The weighted gap that is acted
on by the penalty factor contains the scaling associated with the mortar segments.
A large enough value of the `penalty` parameter is required for the simulation to
yield acceptable interpenetration values. A value too small is likely to
underpredict the stress states of the bodies into contact.

The generalized force generated by this object contains Jacobian information as a
consequence of using automatic differentiation objects. The normal contact pressure
obtained this way is directly applied on the contacting surfaces by
[NormalMortarMechanicalContact](/NormalMortarMechanicalContact.md). That is, the
contact pressure computed by this object serves a purpose analogous to a Lagrange
multiplier when exact enforcement is used
 (see [ComputeWeightedGapLMMechanicalContact](/ComputeWeightedGapLMMechanicalContact.md)). This object is set up automatically
when using the contact action [ContactAction](/ContactAction.md).
