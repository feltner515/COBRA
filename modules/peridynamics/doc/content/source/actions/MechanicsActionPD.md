## Description

The `MechanicsActionPD` Action can be used to setup the Kernel for each component of displacements, the UserObject `GhostElemPD` to ghost connected solutions from other processors due to nonlocality, and AuxVariable `bond_status` for peridynamic mechanics models. More details about this action can be found at the [MechanicsActionPD](Peridynamics/Mechanics/Master/index.md) system page.
