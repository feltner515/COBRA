# Bond-based Peridynamic Heat Conduction Kernel

## Description

The `HeatConductionBPD` Kernel calculates the residual and jacobian of the heat flux integral for 2D, and 3D bond-based peridynamic heat conduction models. More details on the residual and Jacobian formulation can be found in Ref. [!citep](Chen2016bondimplicit).
