# Heat Structures

A "heat structure" is here defined to be a multi-dimensional `Component` on which the
heat conduction equation is solved.

The following components are heat structures:

- [HeatStructureFromFile3D.md]: 3D heat structure using mesh provided by a file.
- [HeatStructureCylindrical.md]: 2D cylindrical heat structure that generates its own mesh.
- [HeatStructurePlate.md]: 2D rectangular plate heat structure that generates its own mesh.
