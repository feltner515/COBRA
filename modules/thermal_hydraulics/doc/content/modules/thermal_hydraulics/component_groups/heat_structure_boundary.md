# Heat Structure Boundaries

These components provide boundary conditions to
[heat structures](thermal_hydraulics/component_groups/heat_structure.md).

The following components fall into this category:

- [HeatTransferFromHeatStructure1Phase.md]
- [HeatTransferFromHeatStructure3D1Phase.md]
- [HSBoundaryAmbientConvection.md]
- [HSBoundaryExternalAppConvection.md]
- [HSBoundaryExternalAppTemperature.md]
- [HSBoundaryHeatFlux.md]
- [HSBoundaryRadiation.md]
- [HSBoundarySpecifiedTemperature.md]
