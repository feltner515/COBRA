# THMCreateMeshAction

!syntax description /Components/THMCreateMeshAction

If created by this action, the mesh created is a [THMMesh.md]. If created by this action,
the problem created is a [THMProblem.md].

This enables input files to not contain a `[Mesh]` block and have a default, empty,
mesh created to satisfy objects that require the presence of a mesh.
