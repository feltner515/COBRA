# ADVolumeJunctionAdvectionScalarKernel

!syntax description /ScalarKernels/ADVolumeJunctionAdvectionScalarKernel

This scalar kernel is used with the [/VolumeJunction1Phase.md] component. It is
used on all of the scalar degrees of freedom associated with the junction model.
All of these residuals are computed in [/ADVolumeJunction1PhaseUserObject.md] and
then retrieved in this scalar kernel.
