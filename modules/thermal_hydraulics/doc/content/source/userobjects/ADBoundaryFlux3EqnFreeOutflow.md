# ADBoundaryFlux3EqnFreeOutflow

!syntax description /UserObjects/ADBoundaryFlux3EqnFreeOutflow

This class implements a boundary flux corresponding to the free outflow boundary
condition, in which the boundary flux is computed solely from interior solution
values:
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{F}_b = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{U}_i) \,.
\end{equation}
