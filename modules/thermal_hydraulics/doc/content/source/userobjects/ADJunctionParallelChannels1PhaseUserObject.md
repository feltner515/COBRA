# ADJunctionParallelChannels1PhaseUserObject

!syntax description /UserObjects/ADJunctionParallelChannels1PhaseUserObject

This user object is used with the [/JunctionParallelChannels1Phase.md] component. It
computes the fluxes that are used in [/ADVolumeJunction1PhaseBC.md] for each of
the connected flow channels and the residuals that are used in
[/ADVolumeJunctionAdvectionScalarKernel.md] for each of the junction's
scalar degrees of freedom.
