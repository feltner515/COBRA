/// Enforces a cell-average constraint
///
///  This kernel enforces a cell-average constraint of the type
///  \int_{V}\left(X_{ij}-\hat{X}_{ij}\right)dV, where $X$
///  is some stress or strain quantity by changing the value
///  of a scalar variable, imposed by CalculateStrainLagrangianKernel
///  as an "extra" additional strain or deformation gradient contribution
///
///  It only works with the TotalLagrangianStressDivergence kernel
///  but works for both large and small deformations
///
///  It relies on the HomogenizationConstraint to actually
///  calculate the residual and jacobian, as they are volume integrals over
///  the domain.
///
///  Also: the scalar-displacement off-diagonal entry, which would be
///  included in this object ideally, instead is implemented in
///  the TotalLagrangianStressDivergence because it varies element by
///  element (and that kernel is already visiting each quadrature point)
