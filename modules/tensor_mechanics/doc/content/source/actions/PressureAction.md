# Pressure Action

## Description

The `Pressure` Action is used to create a set of pressure boundary conditions for a string of displacement variables; the typical use case for this action is the application of hydrostatic pressure. See the description, example use, and parameters on the [Pressure](/Pressure/index.md) action system page.
