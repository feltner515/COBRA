# Coupled Pressure Action

## Description

The `CoupledPressure` Action is used to create a set of pressure boundary conditions for a string of displacement variables; the typical use case for this action is when the pressure is computed in a field variable, for example by a multi-app. See the description, example use, and parameters on the [CoupledPressure](/CoupledPressure/index.md) action system page.
