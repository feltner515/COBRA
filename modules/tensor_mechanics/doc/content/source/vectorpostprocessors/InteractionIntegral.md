# Interaction Integral

!syntax description /VectorPostprocessors/InteractionIntegral

## Description

This is used for the computation of interaction integrals at the points along a crack front within the tensor_mechanics system. This object is not typically defined by a user, but is set up automatically using the [DomainIntegralAction](/DomainIntegralAction.md).

## Theory

Details on the theory behind the computation of the various fracture integrals, including the interaction integral, are provided [here](FractureIntegrals.md).
