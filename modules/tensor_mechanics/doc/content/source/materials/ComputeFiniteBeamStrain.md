# Compute Finite Beam Strain

!syntax description /Materials/ComputeFiniteBeamStrain

## Description

This class computes the rotation matrix that relates the global coordinate system to the current beam local coordinate system for large rotation scenarios in beam elements. Using this rotation matrix, the small/large strain increments in the current local configuration of the beam are also computed by this class. Please refer to [C0 Timoshenko Beam](/C0TimoshenkoBeam.md) for details.
