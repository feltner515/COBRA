# Compute Elasticity Beam

!syntax description /Materials/ComputeElasticityBeam

## Description

This class computes the elasticity vectors (material stiffness and flexure) for the beam element which relates the displacement and rotational strain increments to force and moment increments, respectively. Please refer to [C0 Timoshenko Beam](/C0TimoshenkoBeam.md) for details.
