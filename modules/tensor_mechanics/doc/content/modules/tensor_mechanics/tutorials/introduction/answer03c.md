The thermal expansion eigenstrain added in this input is isotropic, meaning the
material expands not just in the y direction, but also in the x-direction. If we
constrain the x displacement along the entire bottom boundary we will inhibit x
expansion there and thus introduce a strong concentrated stress.

This scenario would model a strip that is "welded" to an infinitely stiff
substrate at the bottom.
