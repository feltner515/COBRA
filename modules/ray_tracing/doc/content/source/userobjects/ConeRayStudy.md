!syntax description /UserObjects/ConeRayStudy

Rays are generated in directions by a product angular quadrature, in which the azimuthal directions are produced by Chebyshev quadrature and the polar directions are produced by Gauss-Legendre quadrature. In the 2D case, the full 3D quadrature is produced and projected into the 2D plane.

For example use and a further description, see [flashlight_source.md].
