# This is a simple 1D test of the volumetric heat source with material properties
# of a representative ceramic material.  A bar is uniformly heated, and a temperature
# boundary condition is applied to the left side of the bar.

# Important properties of problem:
# Length: 0.01 m
# Thermal conductivity = 3.0 W/(mK)
# Specific heat = 300.0 J/K
# density = 10431.0 kg/m^3
# Prescribed temperature on left side: 600 K

# When it has reached steady state, the temperature as a function of position is:
#  T = -q/(2*k) (x^2 - 2*x*length) + 600
#  or
#  T = -6.3333e+7 * (x^2 - 0.02*x) + 600
#  on left side: T=600, on right side, T=6933.3
