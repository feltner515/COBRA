/**
 * This BC applies a heat flux to a boundary, where the heat flux is
 * determined using series conduction resistances, and parallel convection
 * and radiation resistances at the surface. It is assumed that this BC is
 * applied to an equation where `_u` represents a temperature. Note that this
 * BC is only valid for pseudo steady-state problems and with no heat sources in
 * the conduction layers. It is also assumed that the surface is isothermal - if
 * this is not the case, this BC essentially assumes parallel heat transfer
 * between each quadrature point and the surface, with no interaction between
 * adjacent quadrature points. This will underpredict the heat transfer if the
 * surface is not isothermal.
 *
 * When a radiation resistance at the surface is included, the solution requires
 * an iterative procedure because the effective heat transfer coefficient for
 * radiative heat transfer depends on the surface temperature. This iteration is
 * performed with a simple underrelaxation method.
