# Introduction to Heat Conduction

This tutorial guides new users through the process of setting
up a heat transfer model using the Heat Conduction module.
This starts with a simple example that builds in complexity.

## [First steps](heat_conduction/tutorials/introduction/therm_step01.md)

This problem has the minimal set of inputs needed to solve a heat
conduction problem.

## [Adding boundary conditions](heat_conduction/tutorials/introduction/therm_step02.md)

This builds on the model in the previous step by adding boundary
conditions.

## [Sampling values along a line](heat_conduction/tutorials/introduction/therm_step02a.md)

This modifies the previous example by adding output of the value of
the temperature variable along a line, which aids in processing
the results from the model.

## [Adding additional terms to the heat equation](heat_conduction/tutorials/introduction/therm_step03.md)

The earlier examples only included a conduction term in the heat equation.
This adds the time-derivative term.

## [Adding volumetric heating](heat_conduction/tutorials/introduction/therm_step03a.md)

This builds on the previous examples by adding a term for volumetric heating.
