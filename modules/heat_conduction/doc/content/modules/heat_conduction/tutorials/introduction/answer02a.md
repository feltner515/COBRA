The equation being solved is Laplace's equation, which provides the steady-state
version of the heat equation. Spatially uniform values are defined on the left
and right sides of the rectangular solution domain. Since the steady-state
solution is being solved, there are no time-dependent effects, so the temperature
field should vary linearly in the $x$ direction between the left and right boundaries.
The prescribed value on the right boundary should increase with time according
of the function.
