Decreasing either the density or specific would decrease the relative importance of the
time-derivative term in the heat equation. In the limit as either one of these is decreased
to zero, the steady-state solution should be recovered. This would have the same effect
as simply removing that term from the heat equation, as was done in the earlier version of this
example.
