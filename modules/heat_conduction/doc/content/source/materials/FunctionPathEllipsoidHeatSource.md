## Description

This is a material for generating a moving heat source with an ellipsoidal shape that follows a user-defined path, with the volumetric heat source $Q$ being defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
  Q(x,y,z, t) = 6\sqrt{\frac{3}{\pi^3}}\frac{\alpha \eta P}{r_x r_y r_z}
                        \exp\left\{  -3\left[ \left(\frac{x-f_x(t)}{r_x} \right)^2 +
                        \left(\frac{y-f_y(t)}{r_y} \right)^2 +
                        \left(\frac{z-f_z(t)}{r_z} \right)^2  \right]\right\},
\end{equation}
where:\\
-  $P$ is the power\\
-  $\eta$ is the efficiency\\
-  $\alpha$ is the scaling factor\\
-  $r_x$, $r_y$, and $r_z$ are the effective heating spot radii in three directions\\
-  $f_x$, $f_y$, $f_z$ are the heating spot travel path in three directions

This material property is designed to model the heat generated by a laser beam during an additive manufacturing process, which should be applicable to heat sources that have similar characteristics.  Note, this is used together with the [ADMatHeatSource](ADMatHeatSource.md).
