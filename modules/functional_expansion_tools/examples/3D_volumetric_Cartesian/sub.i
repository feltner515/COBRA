# Basic example coupling a master and sub app in a 3D Cartesian volume.
#
# The master app provides field values to the sub app via Functional Expansions, which then performs
# its calculations. The sub app's solution field values are then transferred back to the master app
# and coupled into the solution of the master app solution.
#
# This example couples Functional Expansions via AuxVariable.
#
# Note: this problem is not light, and may take a few minutes to solve.
