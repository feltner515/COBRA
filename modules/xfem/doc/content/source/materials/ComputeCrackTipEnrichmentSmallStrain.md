# ComputeCrackTipEnrichmentSmallStrain

!syntax description /Materials/ComputeCrackTipEnrichmentSmallStrain

# Description

The displacement field contains both the standard and the enrichment solution. The
`ComputeCrackTipEnrichmentSmallStrain` Material calculates the strains from the total displacement
field, including the contributions from both the standard and enrichment solution. This is a drop-in
replacement for the standard strain calculators, and is applicable only to small-strain problems.
