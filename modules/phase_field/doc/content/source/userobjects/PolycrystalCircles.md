# PolycrystalCircles

PolycrystalCircles generates several touching circle particles from centers and radii either from the input file or from a separate file. This object is useful for generating ICs suitable for sintering simulations. Each particle can be assigned an order parameter from the reduced set.

See [Polycrystal Initial Conditions](ICs/PolycrystalICs.md) for more information.
