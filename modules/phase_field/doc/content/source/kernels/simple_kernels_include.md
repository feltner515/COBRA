!alert note
This kernel is part of a set of *simplified* phase field kernels that have been
created for educational purposes. These kernels use simplified formulations with
limitations that prohibit spatially varying mobilities and gradient energies.
The source code of these kernels is kept simple without using advanced C++ features.
