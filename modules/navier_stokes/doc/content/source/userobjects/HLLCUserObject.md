# HLLCUserObject

!syntax description /UserObjects/HLLCUserObject

## Overview

This object computes the HLLC left, middle, and right wave-speeds (see
[CNSFVHLLCBase.md]) from velocity, speed, pressure, density, and specific
internal energy element and neighbor material properties (or left and right
material properties if you want to think of
it that way) on internal faces. These wave speeds can then be used in
objects like [WaveSpeedVPP.md]
