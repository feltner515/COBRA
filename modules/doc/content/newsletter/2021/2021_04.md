# MOOSE Newsletter (April 2021)

## MooseTools

We are working on separating many of our support tools (e.g., testing, docs, GUI) into a separate
repository: [moosetools](https://github.com/idaholab/moosetools). This is being motivated by the
desire for non-MOOSE projects to use these tools. This migration will be ongoing for the next few
months and we will do our best to minimize the impact to users.

The effort will include major improvements with respect to portability, extensiblity, and
documentation. The end product will be more robust and useful for MOOSE and non-MOOSE applications.

## Bug Fixes

- When users call `FEProblemBase/DisplacedProblem::reinitElem/NeighborPhys` with
  a vector of physics points, we now only do the reinit with the requested
  problem. Previously when `FEProblemBase::reinitElem/NeighborPhys` was called,
  in the general case, we would attempt to reinit both the undisplaced and
  displaced problems. This would often lead to failed inversion errors out of
  libmesh because a set of physical points may lie within the mesh subdomain for
  the undisplaced problem but not for the displaced problem, or vice versa.
