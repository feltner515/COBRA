## libMesh-level Changes

- More flexibility in transient adjoint calculations with libMesh::TimeSolver classes
- Automatic support for TIMPI+MetaPhysicL integration, which enables easier
  parallel communication when using Moose Automatic Differentiation
- Compatibility with stricter GCC 11 warnings, avoidance of GCC 11
  optimization flag problems
- Optimizations (and for IsoGeometric Analysis problems, fixes) for
  calculations on element edges, including projections onto higher
  order elements with edge-based degrees of freedom
- Configure option to require HDF5 detection, to ease building with newer
  ExodusII library versions
- Bug fixes in Reduced Basis code, conversion of meshes to second
  order while preserving element integers
- Support for converting spline-node-based IsoGeometric Analysis
  meshes into unconstrained C0 rational Bernstein-Bezier form
- Side element construction caching class, optimizations
