## Compressible Navier-Stokes Finite Volume (CNSFV)

Through the `navier_stokes` module, MOOSE now has the ability to model transonic
and supersonic flows using either Harten, Lax, van Leer, Contact (HLLC) or
Kurganov-Tadmor discretization strategies for the advective flux. The
compressible Euler equations are implemented using the finite volume method. We
have also implemented a variety of slope limiters, including van Leer, min-mod,
first and second order upwind, central differencing, and QUICK, that can be used
when interpolating quantities from cell centroids to faces. We do not recommend
this compressible fluid flow implementation for low Mach number flows as results
can be overly diffusive when the solution is not smooth, e.g. in high Rayleigh
number natural convection simulations.
