## MOOSE Improvements

### Automatically Computed Pressure Drops at Porosity Jumps

We have added the ability to automatically compute the pressure drop at porosity
discontinuities between subdomains according to the Bernoulli equation. When
using the `NavierStokesFV` action a user can toggle the automatic pressure drop
computation by specifying `porosity_interface_pressure_treatment =
'bernoulli'`. Note that this automatic Bernoulli treatment only really makes
sense for inviscid or nearly inviscid flows as significant viscosity greatly
impacts the pressure drop across porosity discontinuities, rendering
Bernoullis's equation inaccurate. In order to properly detect porosity
discontinuities, the user must use an appropriate functor. Any of the following
functors work: `PiecewiseConstantVariable`, any AD functor material property, and
any discontinuous AD function. Normal finite volume variables do not support
automatic porosity jump detection as they interpolate face values from cell
center values.

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2023.01.09` Update

- Added `Elem::orient()` method, to automatically reorder "flipped"
  elements that would otherwise have a negative Jacobian.
- Added `MeshTools::Modification::orient_elements()` method, to
  automatically reorder any and all "flipped" elements in an entire
  mesh.
- Changed `GhostingFunctor::map_type` definition, to shorten +
  optimize `SparsityPattern` construction code.  Typical matrix
  initialization speed is unchanged, common initialization cases are
  approximately 50% faster, and worst-case initialization benchmarks
  are 800% faster.
- libMesh now only prints its own error messages from exceptions which
  are not caught.  Higher-level code catching error exceptions can
  choose whether to print their messages or not.
- Mesh refinement support for Prism21 elements
- `SIDE_HIERARCHIC` finite element support for prisms, higher shape
  function orders on hexes
- Added `Pyramid18` geometry and `Lagrange` basis support
- Nemesis files now support named blocks, sidesets, and nodesets
- Added a flag to control whether nodal quadrature is allowed in pyramids
- Compatibility fixes for MFFD with PETSc 3.18.1
- Replaced deprecated-by-OSX `sprintf()` calls with proper C++
- Added `NodeElem` implementations for `contains_point()` and
  `close_to_point()`
- Added `PetscVector::pointwise_divide()`
- `Xdr` now accepts any `std::string_view` compatible comment
- Bug fixes for Abaqus I/O, Tri7 refinement, `L2_HIERARCHIC` shapes on
  Tri3, and an unnecessary header inclusion

### `2023.01.24` Update

- Fixes and workarounds for NVidia HPC SDK compiler warnings.  These
  compilers are not yet recommended for use, since at least one
  optimizer bug is keeping their builds from passing our full test
  suite, but we do hope to have them in CI testing this year.
- Any `libmesh_*FLAGS` settings given to libMesh configure are now
  passed downstream to software like MOOSE via `libmesh-config`
- Compilation fixes for MetaPhysicL under some configurations
- TIMPI `Packing<std::string>` now uses the same `buffer_type` as all
  the other built-in `Packing` specializations, allowing automatic
  packed-range operations of composite datatypes including string data
  without requiring workarounds like `vector<char>`.
- Major bugfix for TIMPI `Packing<std::tuple<...>>`
- More test coverage for parallel operations on MetaPhysicL
  datatypes using TIMPI methods.
