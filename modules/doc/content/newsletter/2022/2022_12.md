## Support Ended for PETSc 3.5

Full support for PETSc 3.5 has ended, as the few remaining references to 3.5
[have been removed from MOOSE](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/pull/22829). If using PETSc 3.5,
please consider updating to the current supported release (3.16.6) or the alternate tested release
(3.11.4) using either of the `update_and_rebuild_petsc` scripts.

## MOOSE Improvements

Added new ability to [mark a solution as "invalid"](source/interfaces/SolutionInvalidInterface.md).
This gives developers the ability to say that a solution is "out of bounds" for things like material
correlations.  A solution is allowed to be invalid _during_ a nonlinear solve - but not once the solve
has converged.

### MOOSE-Libtorch interface improvements, enabling Deep Reinforcement Learning

The interface between MOOSE and Libtorch has been extended by:

 - wrapped objects that can train artificial neural networks
 - the ability to read neural networks trained in python using a `TorchScript` format
 - an implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm in the Stochastic Tools Module
 - reporters that can print neural network parameters
 - controllers which can use neural networks to control simulations
