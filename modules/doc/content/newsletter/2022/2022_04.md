# MOOSE Newsletter (April 2022)

## LibTorch Support

MOOSE can now be configured to compile with LibTorch (the C++ back end of Pytorch). This
allows the utilization of neural networks for scientific machine learning
directly in MOOSE and consequently in MOOSE-based applications.
For the installation instructions, click [here](getting_started/installation/install_libtorch.md).
More information on the utilization of artificial neural networks can be found here:
[LibtorchArtificialNeuralNet.md].

The MOOSE-LibTorch coupling only supports serial neural net training and does not support GPU-based training.

## MOOSE Improvements

- The [Thermal hydraulics module](modules/thermal_hydraulics/index.md) can now run with distributed memory parallelism (MPI).
  Note that [HeatTransferFromHeatStructure1Phase.md] currently requires a replicated mesh; see [issue](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/20798).

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2022.04.07` Update

- Deprecated shims to C++11 features
  - `libmesh_make_unique` should be replaced by `std::make_unique`
  - `UniquePtr` should be replaced by `std::unique_ptr`
  - `std::is_sorted` and `std::iota` alternatives are deprecated
- Updated many string APIs to take `std::string_view`
- ExodusII updates
  - Always get sideset + nodeset data indices
  - `set_hdf_writing()` is now runtime-configurable
- Parallel (TIMPI) support for communication and reductions of
  `NumberArray`, so `ADReal` can now be used with `MPI` in both sparse
  and non-sparse configurations
- Assorted warning fixes, bug fixes
  - Another small memory leak with Exodus attributes is fixed
  - `MeshFunction::set_subdomain_ids()` now works
  - TIMPI `Packing` for data types which were failing with large
    subtypes now communicate correctly
