MOOSE is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/idaholab/moose) and should be cloned directly from
there using [git](https://git-scm.com/). We recommend creating a directory `{{PATH}}` to contain
all of your MOOSE related work.

To clone MOOSE, run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
mkdir -p {{PATH}}
cd {{PATH}}
git clone https://github.com/idaholab/moose.git
cd moose
git checkout master
```

!alert note
The master branch of MOOSE is the stable branch that will only be updated after all tests are
passing. This protects you from the day-to-day changes in the MOOSE repository.
