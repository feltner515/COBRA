- The Finite Element Method is a way of numerically approximating the solution of PDEs.
- Just like polynomial fitting, FEM finds coefficients for basis functions.
- The "solution" is the combination of the coefficients and the basis functions, and the solution can be sampled anywhere in the domain.
- We compute integrals numerically using quadrature.
- Newton's Method provides a mechanism for solving a system of nonlinear equations.
- The Jacobian Free Newton Krylov (JFNK) method allows us to avoid explicitly forming the Jacobian matrix while still computing its "action".
