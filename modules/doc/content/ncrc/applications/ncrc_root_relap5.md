RELAP5-3D is the latest released code in the RELAP5 series. Developed at Idaho National Laboratory, the RELAP5 family aids in the analysis of transients and accidents in water-cooled nuclear power plants and related systems. The software can also analyze advanced reactor designs. RELAP5-3D differs from earlier code in the series because it offers fully integrated and multi-dimensional thermal-hydraulic and kinetic modeling. It runs on both Linux and Windows operating systems, with training and users group available.
