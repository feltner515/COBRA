# Introduction to Coupled Thermo-Mechanical Modeling

This tutorial provides an introduction to setting up models that combine models
of heat transfer and mechanical deformation, including contact. This builds on the material in the 
[Introduction to Heat Conduction](heat_conduction/tutorials/introduction/index.md),
[Introduction to Tensor Mechanics](tensor_mechanics/tutorials/introduction/index.md), and
[Introduction to Contact](contact/tutorials/introduction/index.md)
tutorials, the completion of which is recommended prior to this tutorial.

There are three parts to this tutorial, which build in complexity.

## [Basic thermal/mechanical coupling](combined/tutorials/introduction/thermomech_step01.md)

This is a basic problem that solves a coupled system of equations for the thermal
and mechanical response of a single block. This builds on the single-block problems
in the Introduction to Heat Conduction and Introduction to Tensor Mechanics tutorials.

## [Thermal/mechanical contact](combined/tutorials/introduction/step01.md)

This problem shows how a coupled thermal/mechanical simulation on two blocks
that interact through both thermal and mechanical contact is defined.

## [More advanced thermal/mechanical contact](combined/tutorials/introduction/step02.md)

This problem adds complexity to the previous problem by adding an additional
body with contact interactions.
