In this example, kinetic rates are modelled using the formula
\begin{equation}
r = MS k e^{\frac{E_{a}}{R(T - 298.15)}}
\end{equation}
where

- $r$ \[mol.s$^{-1}$\] is the reaction rate
- $M$ \[g\] is the mass of the mineral.  This is the number of moles multiplied by the molar weight.
- $S$ \[cm$^{2}$.g$^{-1}$\] is the specific surface area of the mineral
- $k$ \[mol.s$^{-1}$.m$^{-2}$\] is the reaction's intrinsic rate constant
- $E_{a}$ \[J.mol$^{-1}$\] is the reaction's activiation area
- $R = 8.314\ldots\,$J.K$^{-1}$.mol$^{-1}$ is the gas constant
- $T$ \[K\] is the temperature 

Palandri and Kharaka "A compilation of rate parameters of water-mineral interaction kinetics for application to geochemical modeling" list parameters for a wide number of minerals.  In many cases these are based on limited experimental data, so may be subject to large errors.
