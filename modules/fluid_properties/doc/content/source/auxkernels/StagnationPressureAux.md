# StagnationPressureAux

!syntax description /AuxKernels/StagnationPressureAux

Stagnation pressure, or *total* pressure, is the pressure the fluid would obtain if brought to rest isentropically. It is
the sum of static and dynamic pressure. Stagnation pressure is best used to describe reservoirs, pools, and other stagnation
points.

Stagnation pressure is computed from the fluid properties using the static enthropy and stagnation enthalpy.
