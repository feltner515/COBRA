!syntax description /AuxKernels/StagnationTemperatureAux

Stagnation temperature is the temperature is the temperature the fluid would obtain if brought to rest isentropically.
Stagnation points include reservoirs and pools with no flow velocity.

Stagnation temperature is computed from the fluid properties using the stagnation specific volume and the stagnation
specific internal energy.
