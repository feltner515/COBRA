# PorousFlowBrineCO2

!syntax description /UserObjects/PorousFlowBrineCO2

A high precision equation of state for brine and CO$_2$, including the mutual solubility of
CO$_2$ into the liquid brine and water vapor into the CO$_2$-rich gas phase using the accurate
fugacity-based formulation of [!cite](spycher2003) and [!cite](spycher2005).

This model is suitable for simulations of geological storage of CO$_2$ in saline aquifers.

For more details, see the documentation of the [brine and CO$_2$](brineco2.md) equation of state.
