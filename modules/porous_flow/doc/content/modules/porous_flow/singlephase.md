# Single phase flow

PorousFlow provides `Materials` to model single phase flows (both fully
saturated and partially saturated cases) using porepressure as the nonlinear
variable. Multiple fluid components can be included.

- Fully saturated: [`PorousFlow1PhaseFullySaturated`](/PorousFlow1PhaseFullySaturated.md)
- Fully/partially saturated: [`PorousFlow1PhaseP`](/PorousFlow1PhaseP.md)
- Fully/partially saturated with hysteretic capillary pressure: [`PorousFlow1PhaseHysP`](/PorousFlow1PhaseHysP.md)
