# Porous Flow Tutorial Page 12.  Boundary sinks and sources, and polyline sinks and sources

This Page needs further development with an example.  For a lot of information, please see

- [boundaries](porous_flow/boundaries.md)

- [polyline and point sources and sinks](sinks.md) (boreholes, rivers,
  etc)

There are a number of examples of these in the test suite already.  Until this Page is developed further, to find information about boundary terms, `grep` for

- `PorousFlowSink`,
- `PorousFlowHalfCubicSink`,
- `PorousFlowHalfGaussianSink`,
- `PorousFlowPiecewiseLinearSink`

To find further information about polyline point sources and sinks, `grep` for

- `PorousFlowPeacemanBorehole`
- `PorousFlowPolyLineSink`
- `PorousFlowSquarePulsePointSource`
