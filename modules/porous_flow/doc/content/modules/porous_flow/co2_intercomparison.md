# Benchmark problems in CO$_2$ storage in saline aquifers

The [brine-co2](brineco2.md) equation of state available in the PorousFlow module enables
many types of numerical models of geological storage of CO$_2$ in saline aquifers. There are
a number of intercomparison problems that have been studied in the scientific literature that
can be used to assess the applicability of the PorousFlow module to these types of problems [!citep](pruess2002, pruess2004).
