# Using a two-phase system (see dissolution_limited.i for the single-phase)
# The saturation and porosity are chosen so that the results are identical to dissolution_limited.i
#
# The dissolution reaction, with limited initial mineral concentration
#
# a <==> mineral
#
# produces "mineral".  Using mineral_density = fluid_density, theta = 1 = eta, the DE is
#
# a' = -(mineral / (porosity * saturation))' = rate * surf_area * molar_vol (1 - (1 / eqm_const) * (act_coeff * a)^stoi)
#
# The following parameters are used
#
# T_ref = 0.5 K
# T = 1 K
# activation_energy = 3 J/mol
# gas_constant = 6 J/(mol K)
# kinetic_rate_at_ref_T = 0.60653 mol/(m^2 s)
# These give rate = 0.60653 * exp(1/2) = 1 mol/(m^2 s)
#
# surf_area = 0.5 m^2/L
# molar_volume = 2 L/mol
# These give rate * surf_area * molar_vol = 1 s^-1
#
# equilibrium_constant = 0.5 (dimensionless)
# primary_activity_coefficient = 2 (dimensionless)
# stoichiometry = 1 (dimensionless)
# This means that 1 - (1 / eqm_const) * (act_coeff * a)^stoi = 1 - 4 a, which is positive for a < 0.25, ie dissolution for a(t=0) < 0.25
#
# The solution of the DE is
# a = eqm_const / act_coeff + (a(t=0) - eqm_const / act_coeff) exp(-rate * surf_area * molar_vol * act_coeff * t / eqm_const)
#   = 0.25 + (a(t=0) - 0.25) exp(-4 * t)
# c = c(t=0) - (a - a(t=0)) * porosity * saturation
#
# However, c(t=0) is small, so that the reaction only works until c=0, then a and c both remain fixed
#
# This test checks that (a + c / (porosity * saturation)) is time-independent, and that a follows the above solution, until c=0 and thereafter remains fixed.
#
# Aside:
#    The exponential curve is not followed exactly because moose actually solves
#    (a - a_old)/dt = rate * surf_area * molar_vol (1 - (1 / eqm_const) * (act_coeff * a)^stoi)
#    which does not give an exponential exactly, except in the limit dt->0
