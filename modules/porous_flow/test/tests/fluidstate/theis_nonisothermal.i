# Two-phase nonisothermal Theis problem: Flow from single source using WaterNCG fluidstate.
# Constant rate injection 2 kg/s of cold gas into warm reservoir
# 1D cylindrical mesh
# Initially, system has only a liquid phase, until enough gas is injected
# to form a gas phase, in which case the system becomes two phase.
