    # Explanation of the results:
    # - in ma10, the '-1' band is because the 'positions' of the apps are used to find who's nearest, and in the vertical
    #   band, the app on the right is nearest but the band is outside of its bounding box, so the value is invalid
    # - in ma11, the band on the left is for a similar reason. The right subapp position is closer to all points in ma11
    #   but it does not extend over that band
    # - in ma20, the only point that is closer to ma10's position is in the bottom left corner, everything else is closer to ma11
    # - all of ma21 is closer to ma11's position, no value is selected from ma10
