# Master mesh and sub mesh are same with 4x4 quad8 elements.
# parent mesh has top boundary fixed at u=2 and bottom fixed at u=0
# sub mesh has top boundary fixed at u = 0 and bottom fixed at u=1
# The u variable at right boundary of sub mesh is transferred to
# from_sub variable of parent mesh at left boundary

# Result is from_sub at left boundary has linearly increasing value starting
# with 0 at top and ending with 1 at bottom. from_sub is zero everywhere else
# in the parent mesh.
