  # mesh_2d.e is a mesh generated by ConcentricCircleMeshGenerator.
  # This mesh contains two circular subdomains (blocks 1 and 2) and a square background subdomain (block 3).
  # The four sides of the square background regions are named left, right, top and bottom respectively.
  # Two sets of element extra integers are also assigned.
