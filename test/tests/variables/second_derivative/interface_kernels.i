# This is testing a scenario where volumetric system (like kernels) asks for second derivatives
# and the formulation includes a system using neighbor elements (like DGKernels or
# InterfaceKernels)
# If the latter did not request the second derivatives MOOSE should not be computing those.
# The PDEs solved are quite contrived, the Biharmonic kernel is there just to trigger the
# computation of second derivatives.
