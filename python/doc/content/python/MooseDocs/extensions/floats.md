# Float Extension

!alert construction prefix=false title=Developer Extension
This extension has no associated syntax for [MooseDown](MooseDocs/specification.md) files.

The floats extension itself does not provide any syntax for markdown. However, it
does provide building blocks for creating numbered/captioned items such as found
in the [/media.md].
