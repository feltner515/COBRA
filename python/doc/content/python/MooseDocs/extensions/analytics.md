# Analytics Extension

This extension enables the tracking of visits on an HTML rendered website
via Google Analytics. This is done by injecting the javascript tracking
scripts into all rendered pages.

To use it, enable this extension and set the `google_measurement_id` parameter
to the measurement ID as provided by Google.
