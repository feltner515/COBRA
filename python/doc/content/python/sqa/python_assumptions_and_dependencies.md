The software should be designed with the fewest possible constraints. Ideally the software should run
on a wide variety of evolving hardware so it should follow well-adopted standards and guidelines. The
software should run on any [!ac](POSIX) compliant system containing the Python language and interpreter.
The main interface for the software will be command line based with no assumptions requiring advanced
terminal capabilities such as coloring and line control.
