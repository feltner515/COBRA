> Pylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a coding
> standard, looks for code smells, and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored.
> Pylint can infer actual values from your code using its internal code representation (astroid).
> If your code is `import logging as argparse`, Pylint will know that `argparse.error(...)` is in
> fact a logging call and not an argparse call.

> you to access the git repository more directly using either a pure python implementation, or the
> faster, but more resource intensive git command implementation.
>

[!ac](MOOSE) Tools relies on Beautiful Soup, which is summarized as follows on the project website:
[https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

> Beautiful Soup is a Python library designed for quick turnaround projects like screen-scraping.
> Three features make it powerful:
>
> (1) Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating, searching,
> and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for dissecting a document and extracting what you need.
> It doesn't take much code to write an application.
>
> (2) Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to Unicode and outgoing documents
> to UTF-8. You don't have to think about encodings, unless the document doesn't specify an
> encoding and Beautiful Soup can't detect one. Then you just have to specify the original
> encoding.
>
> (3) Beautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers like lxml and html5lib, allowing you
> to try out different parsing strategies or trade speed for flexibility.
