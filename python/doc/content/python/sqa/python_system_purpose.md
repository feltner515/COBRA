[!ac](MOOSE) Tools is a set of Python utilities designed to support the [!ac](MOOSE) framework.
[!ac](MOOSE) Tools contains two main utilities -- [python/MooseDocs/index.md] and [TestHarness.md]
-- that facilitate [!ac](MOOSE) documentation (e.g., website and presentation building) and code testing.
While tied to the framework most directly (and housed within the
[MOOSE code repository](https://github.com/idaholab/moose)), [!ac](MOOSE) Tools can be used in a more
general sense to support other codes. More specific information on the design and structure of
[!ac](MOOSE) Tools utilities can be found on the [main documentation page](python/index.md).

The design goal of [!ac](MOOSE) Tools is to give code developers access to common tools and resources
to help them verify, test, and document their code and simulations, as well as make best use of the
input and output data obtained in the process of performing research. To this end, many of the Tools
utilities are extensible and flexible, like [!ac](MOOSE) itself, and therefore are designed to be
expanded and reconfigured to meet the needs of the end-user.
