This is just here as a place holder. The actual MooseDocs tests reference the MooseDocs/index.md in
the modules directory. The pages MooseDocs/test/content are just test pages and I don't want to
include too much.

!alert note
In the future I would like the actual MooseDocs pages on the website to be the test site, see
[#16248](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/16248)
