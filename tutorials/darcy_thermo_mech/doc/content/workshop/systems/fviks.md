# [Finite Volume Interface Kernels (FVIKs) System](syntax/FVInterfaceKernels/index.md)

System for computing residual contributions from interface terms of a [!ac](PDE) using
the finite volume method.

The contribution is usually a flux term, identical on both sides of the interface for conservation.
