# [Finite Volume Kernels System](syntax/FVKernels/index.md)

A system for computing the residual contribution of a term within a [!ac](PDE) using
the finite volume method.

Finite volume elemental kernels are typically used for volumetric terms (e.g. source, reaction).

Finite volume flux kernels are used for terms integrated by parts (e.g. diffusion) or various fluxes from
neighbor cells (e.g. advection).
