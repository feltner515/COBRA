# [Relationship Manager System](source/relationshipmanagers/RelationshipManager.md)

A system for defining geometric or algebraic information needed to perform a calculation in
parallel.

This information is then "ghosted", which means it is replicated across all the processes that need it. The information is often ghosted in "layers", for the first few elements near a process' domain boundary.
