# NearestNodeValueAux

The NearestNodeValueAux uses the geometric search system to find the shortest distance
from a node where the AuxVariable is defined to a node on a different boundary. The value
of a field variable is then retrieved from the corresponding node. You can use this AuxKernel
to copy the value of a solution field located on one body to another.
