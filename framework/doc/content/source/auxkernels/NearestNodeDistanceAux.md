# NearestNodeDistanceAux

The NearestNodeDistanceAux uses the geometric search system to find the shortest distance
from a node where the AuxVariable is defined to a node on a different boundary. Normally,
this object is used to find distances between two boundaries but can be used to find the distance
from all nodes in one body to some boundary.
