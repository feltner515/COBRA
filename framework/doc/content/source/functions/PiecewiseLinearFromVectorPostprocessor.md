# PiecewiseLinearFromVectorPostprocessor

!syntax description /Functions/PiecewiseLinearFromVectorPostprocessor

## Description

The `PiecewiseLinearFromVectorPostprocessor` function performs linear interpolations between pairs of data generated by a vector post-processor object. The abscissa ([!param](/Functions/PiecewiseLinearFromVectorPostprocessor/argument_column)) and the ordinate ([!param](/Functions/PiecewiseLinearFromVectorPostprocessor/value_column)) values should correspond to the names of member vectors of the object specified for the [!param](/Functions/PiecewiseLinearFromVectorPostprocessor/vectorpostprocessor_name) parameter. By default, the abscissa values correspond to time, and the data will be interpolated at the actual simulation time-step values. However, it is possible to interpolate over spatial (x, y, or z) coordinates by specifying a direction with the [!param](/Functions/PiecewiseLinearFromVectorPostprocessor/component) parameter, where the inputs, `0`, `1`, and `2`, correspond to the `x`, `y`, and `z` directions, respectively.

## Example Input Syntax

In this example, three `PiecewiseLinearFromVectorPostprocessor`s are created and take data from three distinct
vector postprocessors. All three functions use a [!param](/Functions/PiecewiseLinearFromVectorPostprocessor/component)
parameter, which is set so they are functions of space rather than time (y for first two, x for the last one).
