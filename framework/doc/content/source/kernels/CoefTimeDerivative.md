# CoefTimeDerivative

## Description

The `CoefTimeDerivative` kernel implements the time derivative term multiplied by a scalar coefficient.

This class inherents from the `TimeDerivative` class. 

## Example Syntax

A kernel block demonstrating the `CoefTimeDerivative` syntax in a transient diffusion problem can be found below:
