# BilinearInterpolation

The BilinearInterpolation utility applies the Least Squares algorithm to a set of points to provide a piecewise reconstruction
of a surface in 2D. A set of points in both x and y must be provided in conjunction with a set of dependent values (z-values)
to construct the surface. This object is normally not used directly. Instead it is used through the [PiecewiseBilinear.md] object.
