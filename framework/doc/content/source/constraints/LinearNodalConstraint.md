# LinearNodalConstraint

!syntax description /Constraints/LinearNodalConstraint

The LinearNodalConstraint class constrains the secondary node to move as a linear combination of primary nodes. Primary node ids and corresponding weights are taken as input along with the secondary node set or secondary node ids. This nodal constraint can be enforced either using the penalty formulation or the kinematic formulation.
