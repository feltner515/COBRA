# NumVars

The NumVars Postprocessor provides information about the number of variables in the simulation. This postprocessor
is capable of providing the number of variables in either the Nonlinear system (the system of PDEs you are solving),
the Auxiliary system, the system containing only explicit calculations, or both together.
