# FunctionDT

!syntax description /Executioner/TimeSteppers/FunctionDT

## Description

The `FunctionDT` type of TimeStepper takes time steps that vary over time
according to a user-defined function.

The time step is controlled by a piecewise linear function defined using the
`time_t` and `time_dt` parameters. A vector of time steps is provided using the
`time_dt` parameter. An accompanying vector of corresponding times is specified
using the `time_t` parameter. These two vectors are used to form a time step vs.
time function. The time step for a given step is computed by linearly
interpolating between the pairs of values provided in the vectors.

The same procedure that is used with
[ConstantDT](/ConstantDT.md) is used to reduce
the time step from the user-specified value if a failed solution occurs.
If a `growth_factor` is given, it will be applied to every time step until the
current time step predicted by the function is smaller than the current time step multiplied by the
`growth_factor`.
In this sense, the `growth_factor` is the upper limit that any function can increase by.
If no `growth_factor` is provided by the user, the time step will only be governed by the function.
