# ExodusFormatter

The `ExodusFormatter` is a class designed to format MOOSE input syntax to an `Exodus`-format file.
Input files may be saved to the `Exodus` output using an [AdvancedOutput](syntax/Outputs/index.md#advanced-output).

This feature is not currently enabled in MOOSE, but is available to application developers.
