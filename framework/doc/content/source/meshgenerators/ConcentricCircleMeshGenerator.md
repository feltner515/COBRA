# ConcentricCircleMeshGenerator

!syntax description /Mesh/ConcentricCircleMeshGenerator

## Overview

The `ConcentricCircleMeshGenerator` object is to generate 2D mesh for concentric circles. Users can refine mesh by providing a high number of rings for each specified concentric circle region or a high number of sectors in each quadrant. The test, [concentric_circle_mesh_generator.i](test/tests/meshgenerators/concentric_circle_mesh_generator/concentric_circle_mesh_generator.i), explains the use of the 'ConcentricCircleMeshGenerator' object. To execute the test only for generating 2D mesh,

```bash
~/projects/moose/test/moose_test-opt -i concentric_circle_mesh_generator.i --mesh-only
```

To execute the test with the engineering and mathematical physics solvers,

```bash
~/projects/moose/test/moose_test-opt -i concentric_circle_mesh2.i
```

!alert note
Be aware: `ConcentricCircleMeshGenerator` only works with the ReplicatedMesh type.

### More Information

`ConcentricCircleMeshGenerator` works by creating the first quadrant called "top_right." A MooseEnum called 'portion' controls which portion of mesh would be generated. Any other one-fourth portions of circles are generated by rotating the "top_right" portion. Half portions are generated by stitching two different one-fourth portions depending on users' preference.

Users must provide the input parameters, such as:
- number of azimuthal sectors in a quadrant
- list of radii: specific locations of radii of concentric circles
- list of rings: numbers of rings for concentric circles
- inner mesh fraction: ratio of the length of the inner square to the radius of the innermost circle mesh
- volume for concentric circles can be preserved or not (on/off)
- iteration number: number of iterations for Laplace smoothing

Users can choose if the mesh for the enclosing square is added to the concentric circle mesh or not. A portion can be specified, however, it is not required. The default setting generates the full concentric circles.

## Developer Information

If one needs to enhance `ConcentricCircleMeshGenerator,` Laplace smoothing has to be constrained to the center circle. Efficient algorithms for adding nodes and elements, including the connectivity, may be needed. They can be found in `ConcentricCircleMeshGenerator.C`.
