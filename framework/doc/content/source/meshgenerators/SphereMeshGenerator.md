# SphereMeshGenerator

!syntax description /Mesh/SphereMeshGenerator

## Overview

The `SphereMeshGenerator` creates a 3-D mesh of a sphere. The mesh refinement and smoothing parameters define the mesh density. [fig:sphere_mesh] depicts several sphere meshes (sliced in half to illustrate the interior elements) for different selections of refinement and smoothing parameters.
