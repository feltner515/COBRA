The software should be designed with the fewest possible constraints. Ideally the software should run
on a wide variety of evolving hardware so it should follow well-adopted standards and guidelines. The
software should run on any [!ac](POSIX) compliant system. The software will also make use FEM and
numerical libraries that run on [!ac](POSIX) systems as well. The main interface for the software
will be command line based with no assumptions requiring advanced terminal capabilities such as
coloring and line control.
