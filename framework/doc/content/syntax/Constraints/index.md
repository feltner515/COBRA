# Constraints System

The `Constraints` system provides functionality for describing interaction and coupling
between various nodes, elements or surfaces in a model for which the topology may evolve
during the course of the solution. Generically, within an interaction pair, the two sides
are referred to as +Element+ and +Neighbor+ or +Secondary+ and +Primary+. A few examples
of constraints include contact, mesh tying, and periodic boundary conditions.

Since the topology of the interacting nodes and elements may evolve, the direct contributions
to the residual and the Jacobian need to be provided by the developer by overriding the
`computeResidual()` and `computeJacobian()` functions directly. Certain examples for node
and element constraints are listed in the syntax list at the bottom of the page. The remainder
of the description is focused on the application of mortar constraints for surface interaction.

## MortarConstraints

The mortar system in MOOSE uses a segment-based approach for evaluation of mortar integrals; for information on the automatic generation of mortar segment meshes see [AutomaticMortarGeneration.md].

One has the option to use Petrov-Galerkin interpolation for the Lagrange multiplier variable. This is typically useful for mechanical contact problems (see [Petrov-Galerkin_approach_for_Lagrange_multipliers.md]).

### Overview

An excellent overview of the conservative mortar constraint implementation in MOOSE for 2D problems is given in
[!cite](osti_1468630). We have verified that the MOOSE mortar implementation satisfies the following *a priori*
error estimates for 2D problems and (see discussion and plots on
[this github issue](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/issues/13080)) and for 3D problems on *hexahedral* meshes:

| Primal FE Type | Lagrange Multiplier (LM) FE Type | Primal L2 Convergence Rate | LM L2 Convergence Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Second order Lagrange | First order Lagrange | 3 | 2.5 |
| Second order Lagrange | Constant monomial | 3 | 1 |
| First order Lagrange | First order Lagrange | 2 | 1.5 |
| First order Lagrange | Constant monomial | 2 | 1.5 |

General meshes in 3D—especially meshes with triangular face elements on the mortar interface—require additional care to ensure convergence.
Triangular elements on the mortar interface typically exhibit the infamous (and well documented) 'locking' phenomenon; resulting in singular systems that require stabilization or other special treatment.

The above *primal* convergence rates were realized on tetrahedral and mixed meshes using a stabilization with `delta = 0.1` for the `EqualValueConstraint`, with the additional caveat that meshes (both generated and unstructured) are re-generated for each experiment.
Uniform refinement of tetrahedral meshes were typically observed to result in *divergence* of the Lagrange multiplier and degradation of primal convergence rates.
Adaptive refinement of meshes with triangular faces on the mortar interface has not been thoroughly studied in MOOSE and should be approached with caution.

Based on these observations the following recommendations are provided for using *3D* mortar in MOOSE:

1. When possible, discretize the secondary side of the mortar interface with QUAD elements (i.e. use HEX elements or carefully oriented PRISM and PYRAMID elements for volume discretization).
2. When TRI elements are present on the mortar interface, verify that the problem is well conditioned of the problem and use stabilization if necessary.
3. Avoid uniformly refining meshes, instead regenerate meshes when a refined mesh is needed.

!alert note
3D mortar often requires larger AD array sizes than specified by the default MOOSE configuration. To configure MOOSE with a larger array use configuration option `--with-derivative-size=<n>`. The AD size required for a problem depends on 1) problem physics, 2) the order of primal and Lagrange multiplier variables, and 3) the relative sizing of the secondary and primary meshes.

### Parameters id=MC-parameters

There are four
required parameters the user will always have to supply for a constraint derived
from `MortarConstraint`:

- `primary_boundary`: the boundary name or ID assigned to the primary side of the
  mortar interface
- `secondary_boundary`: the boundary name or ID assigned to the secondary side of
  the mortar interface
- `primary_subdomain`: the subdomain name or ID assigned to the lower-dimensional
  block on the primary side of the mortar interface
- `secondary_boundary`: the subdomain name or ID assigned to the lower-dimensional
  block on the secondary side of the mortar interface

As suggested by the above required parameters, the user must do some mesh work
before they can use a `MortarConstraint` object. The easiest way to prepare
the mesh is to assign boundary IDs to the secondary and primary sides of the
interface when creating the mesh in their 3rd-party meshing software (e.g. Cubit
or Gmsh). If these boundary IDs exist, then the lower dimensional blocks can be
generated automatically using the `LowerDBlockFromSidesetGenerator` mesh generator as
shown in the below input file snippet:

```
[Mesh]
  [./primary]
    type = LowerDBlockFromSidesetGenerator
    sidesets = '2'
    new_block_id = '20'
  [../]
  [./secondary]
    type = LowerDBlockFromSidesetGenerator
    sidesets = '1'
    new_block_id = '10'
  [../]
[]
```

There are also some optional parameters that can be supplied to
`MortarConstraints`. They are:

- `variable`: Corresponds to a Lagrange Multiplier variable that lives on the
  lower dimensional block on the secondary face
- `secondary_variable`: Primal variable on the secondary side of the mortar interface
  (lives on the interior elements)
- `primary_variable`: Primal variable on the primary side of the mortar interface
  (lives on the interior elements). Most often `secondary_variable` and
  `primary_variable` will correspond to the same variable
- `compute_lm_residuals`: Whether to compute Lagrange Multiplier residuals. This
  will automatically be set to false if a `variable` parameter is not
  supplied. Other cases where the user may want to set this to false is when a
  different geometric algorithm is used for computing residuals for the LM and
  primal variables. For example, in mechanical contact the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
  conditions may be enforced at nodes (through perhaps a `NodeFaceConstraint`)
  whereas the contact forces may be applied to the displacement residuals
  through `MortarConstraint`
- `compute_primal_residuals`: Whether to compute residuals for the primal
  variables. Again this may be a useful parameter to use when applying different
  geometric algorithms for computing residuals for LM variables and primal
  variables.
- `periodic`: Whether this constraint is going to be used to enforce a periodic
  condition. This has the effect of changing the normals vector, for mortar
  projection, from outward to inward facing.
- `quadrature`: Specifies the quadrature order for mortar segment elements.
  This is only useful for 3D mortar on QUAD face elements since integration of
  QUAD face elements with TRI mortar segments on the mortar interface is
  inexact. Default quadratures are typically sufficient, but *exact* integration
  of FIRST order QUAD face elements (e.g. HEX8 meshes) requires SECOND order
  integration. *Exact* integration of SECOND order QUAD face elements (e.g.
  HEX27 meshes) requires FOURTH order integration.

At present, either the `secondary_variable` or `primary_variable` parameter must be supplied.

## Coupling with Scalar Variables

If the weak form has contributions from scalar variables, then this contribution can be
treated similarly as coupling from other spatial variables. See the
[`Coupleable`](source/interfaces/Coupleable.md) interface for how to obtain the variable
values. Residual contributions are simply added to the `computeQpResidual()` function.

Because mortar-versions of `UserObjects` are not yet implemented, the only way to add
contributions to the Jacobian, as well as the contribution of the mortar spatial variables
to the scalar variable, is through deriving from the scalar augmentation class
[`MortarScalarBase`](source/constraints/MortarScalarBase.md). This class provides
standard interfaces for quadrature point contributions to primary, secondary, lower, and
scalar variables in the residual and Jacobian. Additional discussion can be found at
[`ScalarKernels`](syntax/ScalarKernels/index.md).
