/**
 * Reporter producer/consumer modes
 *
 * @see Reporter, ReporterState, ReporterContext
 *
 * This is used to define the "mode" in which the value is being produced or consumed. The default
 * for both the producer and consumer is ROOT. This means that it is assumed that the
 * correct/complete value of the Reporter value exists on the root processor.
 *
 * On the producer side, it is the responsibility of the Reporter object to perform the necessary
 * operations to compute the value in the specified mode. The ReporterContext objects are helpers
 * for the producer to get the value in the desired mode.
 *
 * On the consumer side, if needed the data supplied will be converted to the correct mode
 * automatically if needed and  possible. If the producer mode is not compatible with
 * the consumer mode, then an error is produced. The base ReporterContext handles the automatic
 * operations and error handling.
 *
 * The UNSET is used as the default to allow the ReporterContext objects to set the value
 * programmatically and error if it is set to something wrong by the user.
