 * Container for holding a function defined on a grid of arbitrary dimension.
 *
 * Information is read from a file.  The file contains the grid, which
 * has dimension _dim, and consists of _dim vectors of Reals.  The
 * file also contains the function values at each grid point.  The
 * file also contains information on how to embed the grid into a
 * MOOSE simulation.  This is achieved through specifying the MOOSE
 * direction that each grid axis corresponds to.  For instance, the
 * first grid axis might correspond to the MOOSE "y" direction, the
 * second grid axis might correspond to the MOOSE "t" direction, etc.
