/**
 * This utility determines element one and element two given a \p FaceInfo \p fi and variable \p
 * var. You may ask what in the world "element one" and "element two" means, and that would be a
 * very good question. What it means is: a variable will *always* have degrees of freedom on
 * element one. A variable may or may not have degrees of freedom on element two. So we are
 * introducing a second terminology here. FaceInfo geometric objects have element-neighbor pairs.
 * These element-neighbor pairs are purely geometric and have no relation to the algebraic system
 * of variables. The elem1-elem2 notation introduced here is based on dof/algebraic information
 * and may very well be different from variable to variable, e.g. elem1 may correspond to the
 * FaceInfo elem for one variable (and correspondingly elem2 will be the FaceInfo neighbor), but
 * elem1 may correspond to the FaceInfo neighbor for another variable (and correspondingly for
 * *that* variable elem2 will be the FaceInfo elem).
 * @return A tuple, where the first item is elem1, the second item is elem2, and the third item is
 * a boolean indicating whether elem1 corresponds to the FaceInfo elem
